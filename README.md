## Requirements

- A terminal (you've got this!).
- An empty repository to push and pull changes.
- A PAT (Personal Access Token) with the right permissions for your repository, including webhook events and pull requests. See [Create a Github Access Token](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/observability-as-code/provision-resources/git-sync-setup/#create-a-github-access-token).
- [grafanactl](https://grafana.github.io/grafanactl/installation/) installed.

## Introduction

[Git Sync](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/observability-as-code/provision-resources/) is Grafana's solution for implementing [Observability as Code (OaC)](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/observability-as-code/). It enables bi-directional synchronization between your Grafana dashboards and a Git repository, allowing you to:

- Version control your dashboards and other Grafana resources
- Review changes through pull requests with visual previews
- Automate dashboard deployments
- Collaborate with team members using familiar Git workflows
- Maintain a single source of truth for your observability stack

This demo will walk you through setting up Git Sync and using it to manage your Grafana dashboards effectively.

## Step 1: Environment Setup

Choose one of the following setup paths based on your current environment:

### Path A: Using an Existing Grafana Instance

If you already have a Grafana instance running, ensure it meets these requirements:

- Grafana nightly build with Git Sync enabled. Follow the [Git Sync documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/observability-as-code/provision-resources/git-sync-setup/).
- Image rendering up and running. Check out the [Image Rendering documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/image-rendering/).
- Webhooks properly configured so pull request comments and instant sync work smoothly.
- Some dashboards and folders already created in your Grafana instance.

Once your existing instance meets these requirements, you can proceed directly to [Step 2: Migrate Dashboards to GitHub](#step-2-migrate-dashboards-to-github).

### Path B: Using the Demo Environment (Docker Compose)

If you want to quickly try out the demo with a fresh environment, you can use the provided Docker Compose setup:

#### Prerequisites for Docker Path
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account and credentials

#### Setup Steps

1. **Set up your ngrok account and credentials:**
   - Sign up for a free account at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)
   - Once logged in, go to your [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) to get your auth token
   - Choose a subdomain name (this will be part of your public URL, e.g., `your-subdomain.ngrok.io`)

2. **Start the demo environment with your ngrok credentials:**
   ```bash
   NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=<your-ngrok-auth-token> NGROK_SUBDOMAIN=<your-desired-subdomain> docker-compose up
   ```
   
   Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the project root with your credentials:
   ```bash
   echo "NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=<your-ngrok-authtoken>" > .env
   echo "NGROK_SUBDOMAIN=<your-desired-subdomain>" >> .env
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Access your Grafana instance:**
   - Your Grafana instance will be available at `https://your-subdomain.ngrok.io`
   - The setup includes pre-configured dashboards and folders for the demo

Once your Docker environment is running, proceed to [Step 2: Migrate Dashboards to GitHub](#step-2-migrate-dashboards-to-github).

**Note**: Ngrok is required to expose your local Grafana instance to the internet so that GitHub can send webhook events for Git Sync's bidirectional synchronization features.

## Step 2: Migrate Dashboards to GitHub

![](./assets/gifs/git-sync-demo-step-1-connect.gif)

Here's how to migrate your existing dashboards to GitHub and enable bi-directional sync between Grafana and GitHub:

- In Grafana:
  - Go to `Dashboards` and check out your existing dashboards and folders.
- In GitHub:
  - Open your repository on `github.com` to see what's inside.
- In Grafana, go to `Administration/provisioning` to set up your first repository:
  - Click in `Configure Git Sync`.
  - Paste your PAT token and enter your repository details. Click `Choose what to synchronize`.
  - Grafana will show you how many dashboards are in your instance and ask if you want to migrate them to GitHub.
  - Select the migration option to sync all dashboards `Sync all resources from external storage` and start the process by click in `Synchronize with external storage` and then `Begin synchronization`.
  - Wait for the migration to complete. Grafana will tell you how many dashboards were successfully migrated.
  - Click on `Choose additional settings`.
  - Enable the `Enable dashboards previews in pull requests` option to have dashboard preview screenshots on pull requests.
  - Click `Finish`.
- In GitHub:
  - Refresh your repository to see a new `grafana` directory containing your migrated dashboards.
  - Look at the folder structure and files.
  - Open a dashboard file to peek at its contents.
- In Grafana:
  - Open the GitHub connection by clicking `View`.
  - Check out the repository status page (e.g., dashboard count, recent jobs, resources tab, and files tab).

That's it! Your Grafana instance is now connected to GitHub with Git Sync, keeping everything in sync.

## Step 3: Use Pull Requests for Your Dashboards

![](./assets/gifs/git-sync-demo-step-2-pull-request.gif)

You can edit dashboards in Grafana and submit changes as pull requests in GitHub before they go live:

- In Grafana:
  - Go to `Dashboards`.
  - Open a dashboard.
  - You will see a purple `<->` badge indicating it's now managed by Git Sync.
  - Make some changes and click on `Save`.
  - A new drawer will pop up for provisioned dashboards with new saving options.
  - Write a commit message.
  - Select `Push to new branch` to create a branch for your changes.
  - Click `Save`.
  - You will be redirected to the dashboards page and see a banner indicating this is a preview and not yet live in Grafana.
  - The banner will offer an `Open Pull Request` button, click on it.
  - A new tab will be opened for you to open a pull request in Github.
- In GitHub:
  - Open the pull request.
  - Wait a few seconds for the Grafana integration to comment on the pull request with before-and-after previews of your dashboard changes.
  - Enjoy the view of the side-to-side comparison.
  - Click on the preview link to see the new dashboard preview render in Grafana.
  - See also that you have a link to go back to your original PR.
  - Edit the dashboard again and save it to the pull request branch which would be selected automatically for you.
  - Close the tab.
  - See the new comment with the new side-by-side comparison.
  - Merge the pull request.
- In Grafana:
  - Go to your dashboard (or refresh) to see the changes were applied automatically.

## Step 4: Edit a Dashboard from Github

![](./assets/gifs/git-sync-demo-step-3-github-com.gif)

- In Github,
  - Go to the dashboard you previously modified (or another one).
  - Edit the title of a panel (e.g. "Modified From Github").
  - Save and push to the branch.
- In Grafana,
  - Go to that dashboard (or refresh).
  - See that changes are now reflected.

## Step 5: Edit a Dashboard Using `grafanactl`

> `grafanactl` is a command-line tool that helps you manage Grafana resources like dashboards, folders, and datasources. The tool integrates with Git Sync, allowing you to manage your dashboards through both the Grafana UI and command line, giving you flexibility in how you work with your dashboards.

![](./assets/gifs/git-sync-demo-step-4-grafanactl.gif)

Here is how you can edit dashboards using `grafanactl` and see the changes reflected in both GitHub and Grafana:

- In your terminal:

  - First, explore the available commands:

    ```console
    grafanactl -h
    Usage:
    grafanactl [command]

    Available Commands:
    completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
    config      View or manipulate configuration settings
    help        Help about any command
    resources   Manipulate Grafana resources

    Flags:
    -h, --help            help for grafanactl
        --no-color        Disable color output
    -v, --verbose count   Verbose mode. Multiple -v options increase the verbosity (maximum: 3).
        --version         version for grafanactl

    Use "grafanactl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
    ```

    This will show you all available options and commands for the CLI tool.

  - Pull the latest resources from Grafana:

    ```console
    grafanactl resources pull
    ✔ 6 resources pulled
    ```

    This command synchronizes your local environment with your Grafana instance, downloading all dashboards and other resources.

  - List all available dashboards and folders:

    ```console
    $ grafanactl resources get folders
    KIND     NAME                                       NAMESPACE
    Folder   demodeeperfolder-xkamwnofnmtnog45gzwhbw9   default
    Folder   demofolder-gmw2mvkigdeajzkygpy7wvlnwbyy0   default

    $ grafanactl resources get dashboards
    KIND        NAME      NAMESPACE
    Dashboard   adg5vbj   default
    Dashboard   admfz74   default
    Dashboard   adn5mxb   default
    ```

    This will display a list of all dashboards with their IDs, which you'll need for editing.

  - Find out the dashboard ID by looking at the file or browser URL.
  - Edit a specific dashboard by peeking at the id:

    ```console
    grafanactl resource edit dashboard <ID>
    # You will be able to edit the dashboard using your default terminal editor
    ```

    Replace `<ID>` with the actual dashboard ID from the previous step. This will open your default editor where you can make changes to the dashboard JSON.

- In GitHub:

  - Navigate to your repository.
  - Check the commit history to see your dashboard changes.
  - Review the changes in the dashboard JSON file.

- In Grafana:
  - Open your dashboards section.
  - Verify that your changes have been automatically synchronized.
